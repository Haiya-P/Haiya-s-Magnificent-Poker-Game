Welcome to Haiya's Magnificent Poker Game project! My project is a simple version of a Poker game made in drafter and coded in python. The game displays my knowledge in regards to python, drafter, and simple game design.
The game works on a point system, losing ten points if you fold, and either gaining 10 or 20 points, or losing 10 or 20 points.
The rules are simple: You will be given 3 cards, you will be up against a computer. You must make the judgement call to either pass or fold. To fold, you must have Three of a Kind (e.g., JJJ or 333), A pair is when exactly two of the three cards have the same rank (e.g., AAX or 422), or a A straight is when the three cards form a sequence (e.g., 987 or JX9).
Any suggestions or crtitism is appreciated!
